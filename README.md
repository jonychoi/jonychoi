ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @JonyChoi, Undergraduate student of Korea University. https://jonychoi.github.io.

My insight is taking a long term to take a glimpse of the Universal Law, the Truth, and I believe that will be realized by technology and literature. I hope to find that and tell to people someday, for the humanity.

**I'm Researching**

- Deep Learning, Computer Vision
- Developing the State of the Arts for Universal Deep Learning Task
- Style Transfer with Implicit Neural Representation
- Developing an End to End DLOPS Architecture
- Revolutionary Interface of Human Computer Interface

**Currently I am**
